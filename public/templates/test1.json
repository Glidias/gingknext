Even then, this would  border around 40 fps territory for certain cases which might not be ideal.\n\nHowever, if I do wish to run Spark AR software though (for work), it requires at least (Intel HD Graphics 4000 / Nvidia GeForce 710 / AMD Radeon HD 6450) video cards.\n\n### RAM: \n8GB DDR RAM is more than  good enough for me.\n\n## New Laptop? (probably not worth it)\n\nEquivalent Mid-level gaming laptops have their price sale offers around $1400 to $1800. \n\nSo, it's around potentially 50% percent to 80% more of cost when it comes to getting PORTABILITY at the expense of slightly less powerful components as mobile hardware counterparts are slightly weaker compared to their desktop equivalents.

For a higher base cost, the amount you save can be significant though.\n\n### Lower end:\n\nOn the lower end, the potential additional cost saving (however slight) comes more in terms of customisability to your exact needs which might not be available from some vendors( eg. deciding to exclude certain things you might not need at a given point of time, especially for things that can be bought LATER at no further cost. \n\nThese are:\n-  Storage space: 240GB space may be more than enough for most general cases.\n-  RAM: 8GB is MORE than good enough for most cases.\n\nEven for the GPU, A significant saving could exist in deciding  to use a lower end GPU first that still meets one's requirement, especially if one has such a GPU lying have one lying around for free (ie. a spare unused one), etc. or get a CPU offer with onboard PPU that is good enough, so you can decide to buy a better GPU later when the need arises at no/little further cost.

Once manuever rolls are commited , they are erased off the chat, and the fecht board state message is updated to reflect those commited rolls. This makes for a very clean look to spectate/view the current fecht situations (and previous situations across previous phases) without any messy chats.\n   - Launches as a fresh new channel the moment game is setup via `!fechtgame {jsonSettings}` command. \n2. `_current-input` - Free for all chat/message/rolling area for all players. Depending on game settings, can allow spectators (non-players) to chat as well.  Can input editable manuever rolls (as messages) for current initiative player  before commiting them for the current initiative player's turn. All roll manuevers are summarised as a custom message from the bot when the player ends the turn`, Can process gm commands.\n  - During `!fechtgame` startup, starts out as a fresh new channel to have all messages cleared, or can still keep existing messages (renamed channel from current channel), depending on `!fechtgame` parameters. \n\n\n### Dice Engine:\n\nhttps://github.com/trwolfe13/dice-typescript\nSimilar to roll20. \n\nWhen it comes to results rendered via `!res` rolls server admin can define a default expression to use for dice rolls (with an optional RegExpr precondition as well).\n\n`!resultExpr /RegExpr/ Earned ${successes} successes.`\n`!resultExpr Blahblah Earned  ${successes}.`\n\n_____________________\n\n- `!fechtchannels 20 Category Label` allows admin to set the maximum allowed player-initiated feche channels that can be set up among players via the `!fecht @Player @Player2 @BlahblahPlayer {jsonSettings}` invitation. \n\n- Admin can use `!default-fecht {jsonSettings}` on server to define default jsonSettings for fecht setups.\n\n- For a `fecht` invitation, a React invite will be created and if all other relavant players reacted to the Fecht by pressing the react button, the fecht channel starts in the respective category.\n\n\n- You can direct message editable input rolls for a game, assuming you set the current game for yourself at `!dmjoin` under the given channel . Otherwise, you can post messages to either input or the main current channel. If so, anytime it's your turn in the game you had `dmjoin`ed, the Bot will direct message you as well. Using !dmjoin and commiting your roll manuevers can be a great way of keeping certain roll manuevers hidden from other players until resolution, if this is allowed by the rules.\n\n- If it's your turn, type `!end` to finish turn or click on react button of Bot's prompt message at the `current` or direct message channels to finish turn and commit new manuever rolls. A game/phase setup countdown setting might be used to force end turn immediately if time limit runs out, and the time limit is shown on the message itself.\n\n- Each game you are limited to a max limit of new manuever rolls per character, depending on game/phase setup. Delete off old rolls/new manuever rolls accordingly.\n\n- Manuever rolls can be made in reply to ANOTHER player's character's manuever roll if it's targeted at your character. This is considered free and isn't part of the max limit.\n\n- If `current` channel is deleted off, game is considered \"gone\" and no longer tracked.
